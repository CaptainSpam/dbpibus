A Desert Bus for Hope Raspberry Pi project.

This repository keeps track of the progress of this weird idea I had to make a craftalong project for Desert Bus for Hope.  It'll involve a Raspberry Pi, an LED character display, a few RGB LEDs, a bus-shaped shell around it, and it'll look neat.

Ultimately, this won't be very useful to anyone else unless they have a list of parts I intend to use, which I'm still hashing out.  At the very least, the current plan involves:

- A Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- Adafruit's RGB backlight negative LCD 16x2 + extras - RGB on black (https://adafru.it/399)

Later, there will also be LEDs and buttons, too, but the specifics are still up for debate.
