        There is no guarantee that a given view will handle the next frame that
        needs processing, even if the view isn't finished yet.  Any view can be
        interrupted by something of a higher (lower-numbered) priority, in which
        case the lower-priority view just won't get any next_frame calls until
        the higher-priority view finishes and yields control.  In fact, that's
        the entire way NormalView is intended to work.
