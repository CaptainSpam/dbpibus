# This is mostly ported over from DonationConverter in DBWidget.  Or at least as
# close as I could get it without some of Java/Kotlin's fun tricks, like
# NavigableMap or whatnot.

# The thresholds of donations needed for each hour.  The zeroth index represents
# one hour of bussing.  This is handy so we don't need to do floating point math
# if we don't want to.  The array goes out to 256 hours of bussing, which is
# quite genuinely absurd for DB, but if we DO need more for some reason, we'll
# just do the dang floating point math, I guess.
